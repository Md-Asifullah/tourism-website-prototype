            <p class="card-text">Do you want to go somewhere remote so you can enjoy Paris without the crowds? Have you already visited France but wish to see a different aspect of it? Do you desire a genuine travel experience with a little luxury? Whether you want to go to France alone, with friends, or with a loved one, we would love to learn more about your travel tastes and develop the perfect itinerary for you.</p>
            <p class="card-text">An upscale DMC operates in France. In Paris and around France (Champagne, Normandy, Provence, Brittany, French Riviera), we create custom vacations. We design one-of-a-kind itineraries and exclusive experiences to explore France authentically. We assist our clients in planning all or a portion of their vacation (transfers, exclusive lodging, private excursions, concierge service, etc.).

                Families, couples, single travelers, large groups of friends, and business travelers—foreign clients or colleagues visiting France on business—all make up our clientele.

                Hello, everyone! Jane Doe is my name, and I work as a trip designer for Paris Tourism. Regarding my previous positions, I have marketing, customer service, and reception expertise at several hotels. I am happy to be working in my favorite sector, the travel and tourist business. I communicate daily with incredible vendors.

I'm pleased to create our visitors' itineraries around France. I adore introducing people to our amazing history, gastronomy, architecture, and art!

I enjoy doing yoga and listening to music in my leisure time.
